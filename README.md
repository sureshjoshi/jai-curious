# jai-curious

Some code snippets testing out language features and trying to build out functionality I like from other languages. There's likely some re-inventing the wheel, but the point is to get more familiar with the language outside of a gaming context - to see if I can use it for some of my systems programming use cases.

## Warnings

I got access to the Jai beta yesterday-ish (mid-Jan 2025) - so I would assume every line of code in this repo is/will be sketchy and unreliable for a long time.

## Ideas

- [ ] Simple testing framework (inline unit tests? tests file alongside? tests folder? No idea)
- [ ] Optional<>, Result<>
- [ ] Static import into Swift (can't get static libs importing on Linux, works with shared libs - but my strings are getting lost along the way)
- [ ] Compile-time sqlite checks (lightweight version of `sqlx`, as few bells and whistles as possible)
- [ ] `jaifmt` (just whitespace really, don't care much about the rest)
- [x] Binding to a non-trivial library (this gives me some ideas re: [FastJaiPI](https://github.com/RobotPajamas/FastJaiPI))
- [ ] LSP (this won't really bring me much enjoyment, so I doubt it)
- [x] VSCode extension (adding in grammar as I go through the tutorials and might add some quality of life modifications: [Jaive Turkey](https://github.com/RobotPajamas/jaive-turkey))
