# jai-curious

Some code snippets testing out language features and trying to build out functionality I like from other languages. There's likely some re-inventing the wheel, but the point is to get more familiar with the language outside of a gaming context - to see if I can use it for some of my systems programming use cases.

## Ideas

- [ ] Simple testing framework (inline unit tests? tests file alongside? tests folder? No idea)
- [ ] Optional<>, Result<>
- [ ] Static import into Swift (can't get static libs importing on Linux, works with shared libs - but my strings are getting lost along the way)
- [ ] Compile-time sqlite checks (lightweight version of `sqlx`, as few bells and whistles as possible)
- [ ] `jaifmt` (just whitespace really, don't care much about the rest)
- [ ] LSP (this won't really bring me much enjoyment, so I doubt it)
